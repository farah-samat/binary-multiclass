In this part, a subset of [Wisconsin Breast cancer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)  is used.<br></br>

## Part 2 Handwritten digits recognition using one-versus-rest classifier.
A small subset of [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is used.<br></br>

Both parts are combined in a single [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/farah-samat/logistic-regression/blob/master/binary_and_multiclass.ipynb).
